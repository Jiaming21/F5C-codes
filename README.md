### Resf5C-Pred and ensemble models
5-Formylcytidine (f5C) is a unique post-transcriptional RNA modification found in mRNA and tRNA at the wobble site. It plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis and potentially contributes to the regulation of translation. The precise identification of modification sites is crucial for understanding its molecular functions and specific regulatory mechanisms, but there are currently no computational methods available for predicting f5C sites. Here, we introduce Resf5C-Pred, the first f5C predictor, which combines the sequence and 32 domain characteristics through a deep learning method, achieving an AUROC of 0.80 on both 5-fold cross-validation and an independent dataset, compared with a series of sequence-only computational approaches, ranging between 0.71â€“0.74. Moreover, we build ensembles of multiple methods, which exhibit superior performance with an AUROC of 0.83. We interpreted computational approaches by analyzing how different features contribute to the overall predictions. To facilitate the identification of putative f5C sites, we develop a freely accessible web server that allows real-time analysis of user-uploaded sites. The web server can be accessed at: www.rnamd.org/Resf5C-Pred.
